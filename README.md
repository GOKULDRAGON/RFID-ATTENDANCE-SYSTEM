SAR: IoT-Based Search and Rescue System
Welcome to the SAR (Search and Rescue) repository! This project focuses on leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) technology to improve and automate search and rescue operations. The goal is to develop a system that can efficiently detect, locate, and assist individuals in need during emergencies using a network of connected devices and sensors.

Overview
SAR is designed to provide real-time monitoring, tracking, and communication capabilities to search and rescue teams. By integrating various IoT devices, the system can gather critical data, enhance situational awareness, and facilitate prompt responses in disaster or emergency scenarios.

Key Features
Sensor Integration: Utilizes a range of sensors (GPS, temperature, humidity, motion, etc.) for data collection and environmental monitoring.
Real-Time Tracking: Monitors the location and movement of both rescuers and victims.
Wireless Communication: Employs wireless protocols (such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or LoRa) for robust connectivity across large areas.
Data Visualization: Presents live data and alerts via dashboards or mobile applications.
Automated Alerts: Generates notifications for abnormal readings or detected emergencies.
Project Structure
Hardware Design: Schematics and PCB layouts for IoT sensor nodes and communication modules.
Firmware: Embedded code for microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) to interface with sensors and manage data transmission.
Backend: Server-side scripts and databases to collect, store, and process incoming data.
Frontend: User interfaces for visualization, tracking, and alert management.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of IoT and embedded systems
Microcontroller development boards (such as Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi)
Sensors (GPS, temperature, humidity, etc.)
Wireless modules (Wi-Fi, Zigbee, LoRa, etc.)
Python/JavaScript for backend and frontend (based on project implementation)
Setup
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/DeepakPS-2005/SAR.git
Hardware Assembly:
Assemble the sensor nodes as per hardware schematics.
Flash the firmware onto microcontrollers.
Backend Deployment:
Set up the server and database (see /backend for details).
Configure endpoints for data ingestion.
Frontend Launch:
Run the dashboard or mobile app to start monitoring.
Testing:
Simulate sensor readings and verify data flow from devices to dashboard.
